<h1>These are some aircraft models of my collection</h1>
	
<div class="neoancho"><h2 id="pink">The American Vought F4U-1D Corsair (1945 1:72)</h2><p>Designed around the new Pratt & Whitney 2,000HP radial engine and tuning the largest propeller ever attached to a fighter plane, the Vought F4U Corsair became a legend in its own time. The F4U-1 was the first production version of the Corsair. It had an inverted gull wing and a production version of the Corsair. It had an inverted gull wing and a framed canopy with a flat top. However may problems were found soon. For example, the port wing stall often gave the Corsair unstable landing. Anther problem was poor visibility because of its long nose and framed canopy. </p></div>
<div class="neoancho"><h2 id="red">The British Supermarine spitfire Mk Vb (1941 1:72)</h2><p>The Supermarine Spitfire is regarded by many as the most esthetically designed single seat fighter to appear during the Second World War. It was conceived by the brilliant British designer Reginald J. Mitchell, and first flew on 5 March 1936. It was an advanced, low wing single seat monoplane with a very smooth flush riveted metal skin and a long flowing front cowling. Using the famous RollsRoyce "Merlin' liquid cooled 12 cylinder engine that produced more than 1,000 horsepower, the Mk I Spitfire attained a top speed of 586km/h. The very distinctive elliptical shaped wing was useful in reducing parasitic drag and allowed a fairly thin wing construction. It carried a large coolant radiator under the starboard wing, and a small oil cooler under the port wing, giving it an asymmetrical appearance when viewed from the front and bottom. The retractable main landing gear also contributed to its smooth lines, and gave it higher performance.</p></div>
<div class="neoancho"><h2 id="yellow">The Russian Ilyushin Il-4 (1942&nbsp1:144)</h2><p> In 1938, the Ilyushin design bureau redesigned the Ilyushin DB-3 to ease production and improve its performance, the revised version receiving the designation DB-3F (Forsirovanniye or "boosted"). The aircraft's internal structure, particularly the wings, was extensively changed, eliminating the need for hand finishing of the structure, and with duralumin replacing the large scale use of steel in the earlier version. The aircraft's fuel system was redesigned, increasing its internal capacity while reducing the number of fuel tanks. The fuselage nose was lengthened to give more room for the navigator/bombardier while reducing drag. The prototype DB-3F, powered by the same 949 hp (708 kW) Tumansky M-87B engines of the DB-3M, was piloted on its maiden flight by Vladimir Kokkinaki on 21 May 1939. It successfully passed through state acceptance tests and entered production in January 1940, with the 1,100 hp (820 kW) Tumansky M-88 quickly replacing the M-87. The DB-3F was redesignated Il-4 in March 1942.</p></div>
